# Publish Internal Templates

Inside WayScript, you can transform your [Lair](platform/lairs/) into a reusable, internal template. This is useful for publishing reusable templates for your team ([scheduled tasks](quickstart-schedule-task/), [microservices, webhooks](quickstart-webhook-microservice/), or [web servers](quickstart-spin-up-server/)).&#x20;

When a Lair is published, it's [Code](platform/lairs/file-system.md), Packages, Documentation, [Alerts](platform/lairs/alerts.md), and [Environment and Secrets Variables](platform/lairs/environment-variables.md).

### Publishing Your Template

Inside of a Lair, go to Publish in the Settings Tab. Click the [Publish](platform/lairs/publishing.md) Button (top right) and toggle `Publish to your workspace template library.` &#x20;

From your Lair Overview, your template will now be available under `Workspace Templates` when a New Lair is created.&#x20;
