# Tables

WayScript Tables is a lightweight storage solution you can read and write to from both your WayScript Lairs and external tools. They are robust, easy to generate, and backed by a Postgres SQL database. Use WayScript to query, read/write, and transform your data in a single place. WayScript Tables makes it easy to answer any business question at any time.&#x20;
