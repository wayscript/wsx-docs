# Publishing

Your Lair can be published to share with publicly with external audiences. Once published, your Lair's file system can be cloned to a WayScript user's workspace with a single button.&#x20;

### Publishing your Lair&#x20;

Navigate to the 🌎 “Publish” tab in your Lair's toolbar. Click the "Publish" button to generate a published link.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Your Lair must be deployed to a production environment before it can be published, and on clone, your Lair's file system on its production environment will be shared. Please see [deployments.md](deployments.md "mention") for more details.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
