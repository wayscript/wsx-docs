# Endpoints

When certain [triggers](triggers.md) are added to your Lair, WayScript auto-generates custom endpoints to provide external access to your tool. By default, endpoints are unique to each Lair environment (see [deployments.md](deployments.md "mention") for more details on environments) and protected to be only accessible by workspace members.&#x20;

### Making requests to protected endpoints

Requests to protected endpoints can be made in two ways:

* If the requests are made through a browser, they can be authenticated through WayScript's standard account credentials. As per standard session management, WayScript stores these credentials as cookies so subsequent requests do not require repeat entry of credentials.&#x20;
* If requests are made outside of the browser, they can be authenticated using a WayScript workspace member's application key. See details below on how to access and use your application key.

#### Accessing your application key

Your application key can be accessed by navigating to your workspace settings and selecting "Application Key". You can then view and/or copy your application key.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Application keys are unique both per workspace member and per workspace (if the account is a member of multiple workspaces). If your application key is compromised, you can regenerated a new key, which will invalidate your old key. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Making requests using application key

Requests made to protected Lair endpoints outside the browser must pass a workspace member's application key in the `Authorization` header as a bearer token.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Example: curl" %}
```bash
$ curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Application Key>' '<Lair endpoint URL>'
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example: Python" %}
```python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <Application Key>'
}
lair_endpoint_url = '<Lair endpoint>'

response = requests.get(lair_endpoint_url, headers=headers)
print(response.content)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you receive a 403 response when accessing your endpoint, and are providing an `Authorization` header with a valid bearer token, try ensuring your request is sending a valid `User-Agent` header as well.
{% endhint %}

### Viewing your Lair's endpoints

Navigate to the ðŸ”— Endpoint tab in your Lair toolbar to view a list of all generated endpoints for your Lair.

#### Setting endpoints to be publicly accessible

Toggle the selector to allow public access to your Lair's generated endpoints.

### Changing Lair's Subdomain

When a lair is created, a unique subdomain is automatically assigned. This subdomain can be changed by clicking the "pencil" icon under the "Subdomain" header on the "Endpoints" tab.

{% hint style="info" %}
Changing the subdomain will not update the production environment's endpoints until the lair is re-deployed.
